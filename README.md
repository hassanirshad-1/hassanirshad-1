# Hi 👋 I'm Hassan

Building **reliable, governed, and production-grade AI agents** — not demos.

Focused on **AI-native and AI-first systems**, designed through **specifications, not prompt hacks**.  
I care about systems that **ship**, **scale**, and **behave predictably**.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
**Spec-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI)**  
Design first. Specs over syntax. Intelligence you can test, version, and reuse.

---

## 🤖 Agentic & AI Frameworks
- OpenAI Agents SDK  
- CrewAI  
- LangGraph  
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Infra
- Docker · Kubernetes  
- Dapr Sidecars  
- Microservices-based systems  
- PostgreSQL 
- CI-driven, spec-first workflows

---

## 💻 Languages
- Python  
- TypeScript

---

## 🎨 Frontend
- Next.js
- React.js  
- Chat-based & Agent-driven UIs

---

## 🚀 Open Source & Projects
- 🏆 **[Robotics-AI TEXTBOOK](  https://hassanirshad-1.github.io/Humanoid-AI-book/)** — AI agent-based system  

- 🤖 **[Customer Support Chatbot](https://github.com/hassanirshad-1/Customer_support_agent)** — custom end-to-end agentic chatbot  
  

---

## 📌 What I Care About
- Agent reliability & governance  
- Spec-first system design  
- Production-ready AI (not toy demos)  
- Clear contracts between humans, agents, and tools

---

_Always building. Always shipping._
